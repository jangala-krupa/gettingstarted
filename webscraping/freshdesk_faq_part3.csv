SAML Authentication in FreshID," Overview of SAML     Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a mechanism used for communicating identities between two web applications. It enables web-based Single-Sign-On and hence eliminates the need for maintaining various credentials for various applications and reduces identity theft.     How does SAML SSO in Freshworks work?    User wants to login to Freshworks using SAML SSO.    Freshworks redirects the user to the login URL the Identity Provider. for example. OneLogin. provides.     User enters their credentials and OneLogin validates the user.     OneLogin redirects the user to Freshworks’ Consumer Assertion URL and passes an SAML Assertion telling Freshworks that the user is valid.    User Attributes like Email address. First name and Last name of the user will be sent along with the Assertion by OneLogin to Freshworks.     Freshworks verifies OneLogin’s SHA-256 certificate and grants the user access.        The address of the user is the only required field that Freshworks needs. Here is a sample code of how the email address is passed:       <saml:NameID Format=""urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress"">example@test.awesomecompany.com</saml:NameID>     SAML usually involves three things:     A user   The person requesting the service.  A service provider   The application providing the service or protecting the resource.  An identity provider   The service/ repository that manages the user information.     A user requests for a SAML SSO to access a resource that is protected by a service provider. The service provider requests the identity provider to authenticate the user. The identity provider checks the existence of the user and sends back an assertion to the service provider that may or may not include the user information. The communication between the identity and service providers happens in the SAML data format.      You can configure Freshworks to act as a service provider in this mechanism. You can use your own SAML server to act as an Identity provider or you could use some third party applications like OneLogin. Okta etc.     Fields required by your Identity Provider     The identity provider requires a Consumer Assertion URL to which it redirects the user after the authentication. Freshworks team will provide a custom assertion URL for your account and you can use this URL to configure SAML in your Identity Provider.  When the user requests for SAML SSO by arriving at the Freshworks URL. the XML Assertion will be sent to this URL.    "
How to configure SSO with OpenID Connect," Freshworks supports Single Sign-On (SSO). a process that allows users to authenticate themselves against an external Identity Provider (IdP) rather than obtaining and using a separate username and password handled by Freshworks.   Under the SSO setup. Freshworks can work as a Service Provider (SP) allowing you to provide Single Sign-On (SSO) services for your Freshworks accounts.    You will need an OpenID Connect Identity Provider (IdP). which will handle the sign-in process and will eventually provide the authentication credentials of your users to Freshworks. Freshworks users authenticated through your OpenID Connect IdP are handled from your IdP and any change they perform on their account (namely first name. last name. and email) is synced back to their Freshworks profile. The only user data that is necessary for Freshworks is a unique identifier for each user. user's first name. last name. and email. Freshworks does not store passwords.    What you will need to configure SSO with  OpenID Connect are:  the client id the client secret the OpenID Connect endpoint URLs   Enabling OpenID Connect SSO in your Freshworks account    Log in to your Freshworks account as a Org-admin and go to Security settings page from the left navigation bar.  SSO integration type: Choose OpenID Connect from the drop-down list. Client id: is the OpenID Connect client id provided by your IdP.   Cline secret: is the OpenID Connect client secret provided by your IdP. Token endpoint URL: is the OpenID Connect token endpoint URL provided by your IdP. User info endpoint URL: is the OpenID Connect User info endpoint URL provided by your IdP that holds user's profile data (name. email. username etc). Authorization endpoint URL: is the OpenID Connect authorization endpoint URL where Freshworks issues authentication requests. The rest fields define the variable names of the OpenID Connect protocol containing user data provided by your IdP.  that is essential for Freshworks.  Username: this is the username of the user account and should be a unique identifier for each user. Default value: uid First name: the first name of the user. Default value: given_name   Last Name: the last name of the user. Default value: family_name Email: the email address of the user. Default value: email. Note that email is essential for Freshworks communication. so you should make sure that all users have valid email addresses. Group: the group(s) name(s) that the user is a member of. This variable may hold a single string value (group name) or an array of string values (groups names). If a group with the same name exists in your Freshworks account. then the user will be assigned to that group and will get all courses of that specific group on his/her first login. The option “Add assigned groups with each login” can be selected to force group assignment on each login. Have in mind that with this option the user is not removed from groups to match those sent by your IdP. Instead. only assignments to new groups are performed. Identity provider (IdP) configuration The next step is to ensure that your IdP is capable of communication with your SSO-enabled Freshworks service provider. Below. you can find all you need for your IdP configuration. Replace [your domain] with your domain name. For example. if you access your Freshworks through example.Freshworks.com. then replace [your domain] with an example.  The Authorized redirect URL is: https://[your domain].Freshworks.com/simplesaml/module.php/openidconnect/resume.php Post logout redirect URL is: https://[your domain].Freshworks.com/index/logout. This is optional and is the Freshworks endpoint where users are redirected after a successful logout from your IdP.  Configure SSO with Google OAuth 2.0 APIs which conform OpenID Connect Specification Google's OAuth 2.0 APIs can be used for both authentication and authorization. Google's OAuth 2.0 implementation for authentication. conforms to the OpenID Connect specification and is OpenID Certified. Thus. it can be deployed to provide SSO services for Freshworks.  Before Freshworks can use Google's authentication system. you must configure a new project in the Google's API console to obtain OAuth2.0 credentials (ie. client id and secret) and set the Authorized redirect URL. Go to Google's API console (https://console.developers.google.com/) and create a new project. Then select ""Credentials"" from the left sidebar and click on the ""Create credentials"" button. and select ""OAuth client ID"".  <image>  Next. click on the ""Configure consent screen"" in order to provide information that the user is releasing and the terms that apply when trying to login to Freshworks through Google. You can configure there the product name shown to users. the homepage URL. the product logo URL. the privacy policy URL. and the terms of service URL. Click on ""Save"" and on the next screen select ""Web application"" from the available options. give a name and paste the ""Authorized redirect URL"" found at the bottom of the Freshworks SSO configuration form. This URL is of the form https://[your domain].Freshworks.com/simplesaml/module.php/openidconnect/resume.php. You need to replace [your domain]. with your actual Freshworks domain and click on ""Create"".  <image>  Then. you will be provided with the Client id and client secret. which should be copied to the respective fields in the Freshworks SSO with OpenID Connect form.  <image>  The OpenID Connect endpoints (token. user info. and authorization endpoints) can be found in the following OpenID Connect Discovery document  https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration  The following key/value pairs are found there and should be copied to the respective fields in the Freshworks SSO with OpenID Connect form.  Token endpoint: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token  User info endpoint: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo  Authorization endpoint: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth  You can let the rest fields with their default values:  Username: uid  First name: given_name  Last name: family_name  Email: email  Group: blank  Click on the ""Save and check your configuration"" button. login with your google account when prompted and inspect what attribute/value pairs Google sends for your account.   User Account Matching    At the time of writing of this document. Freshworks provides a passive mechanism for User Account Matching. This means that existing Freshworks user accounts are matched against SSO user accounts based on their username.   User account matching is only possible in the case where the username provided from your IdP is exactly the same with an existing Freshworks account's username. In this case. the Freshworks user account state will remain unchanged during SSO login process. However first name. last name. and email will be pulled from your IdP and will replace existing values.  If the username provided by your IdP. for an existing Freshworks user. is different from his/her Freshworks username. a new account will be created with the IdP provided username. In this case. there will exist two different accounts for the same person.  To ensure that User Account Matching will be performed successfully. you should configure your IdP to sent the same username for existing user accounts. The OpenID Connect attribute name that carries the username can be defined in the  ""Username"" field at the Freshworks SSO configuration page.  User Profile  Even though your users are allowed to change their profile (first name. last name. email. and username) this is strongly discouraged. Changing the first name. last name and email will impact only the current session. The next time a user signs-in. those values will be pulled from your IdP server. Changing the username will result in the undesirable effect of user mismatching since users are matched based on this value. So. you should notify your users how SSO affects your Freshworks domain and avoid changing the first name. last name. email and especially username form their profile.  If your users are authenticated only through SSO it is a good practice to disable profile updates for your users by changing the specific user group permissions. To disable profile updates for your learners go to dashboard click on User Types → Learner-Type → Generic → Profile and make sure that ""Update"" and ""Change password"" are not checked (1).  <Image>   Congratulations  You have now configured your Freshworks account to provide SSO services. Your users may log in to your Freshworks account using the username and password stored in your OpenID Connect Identity Provider.     "
